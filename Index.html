       <p id="txtp1">Traveling to new destinations is always an experience. Let these talks 
    encourage you to think differently about the places you visit and the people you see
    .It’s been a wild ride, and I’ve learned a lot since I first left. To celebrate my “travelversary”, 
    I’ve decided to share a collection of my best and most useful travel tips to help inspire you to
     make travel a priority in your life.</p>

        <h2 id="esmp2"> Pets </h2>
        <p id="txtp2">Ready to add a new love to your family? There are so many wonderful pets in your
             community waiting for loving homes. Put your love
             into action by adopting today - and spread the word that adoption is the way to go.
             We keep pets for pleasure. Some people keep dogs as pets. Others keep birds, pigeon
             or rabbits as pets.Pets are like our family members. </p>

    <h2 id="esmp3">Health</h2>
    <p id="txtp3">Living a healthy lifestyle doesn’t mean hours of training at the gym and eating only salad leaves.
         It’s about making easy-to-manage healthy choices in your day-to-day living.
         Says Dr Craig Nossel, head of Wellness at Discovery Vitality: "The trick to making your lifestyle
          healthier is to make small healthy changes every day, such as taking the stairs instead of the lifts,
           increasing your fruit by one, drinking one extra glass of water or quitting smoking."

            <h2 id="esmp4">LifeStyle</h2>
            <p id="txtp4"> Nowadays life is becoming more and more stressful. People live under the pressure
             of various problems social, ecological, economical and others. They constantly suffer from stress, 
             noise and dust in big cities especially urban places. In order to overcome all difficulties a person
              should be strong and healthy, take care of physical and mental health. There are several ways to do 
              that. Sport is of primary importance.</p></span>

                    <p id="txtp5">My dear babes in Makeup Land. Let’s take a moment here and really consider
                         the stuff we put on our faces. Are you doing yourself a service or disservice? Do you 
                         really know what you're doing? Are you playing makeup or are you bossing it all the way 
                         out? Are you buying the right products? Do you know the history of those products? 
                         Basically, do you know anything about anything about that makeup you so adamantly love?
                          Don’t fret take care of physical and mental health. </p>  </span>

                            <h2 id="esmp6">Creativity</h2>
                            <p id="txtp6">Creativity is a phenomenon whereby something new and somehow valuable is
                                 formed. The created item may be intangible (such as an idea, a scientific theory,
                                  a musical composition, or a joke) or a physical object (such as an invention, a 
                                  literary work, or a painting).

                                    Scholarly interest in creativity is found in a number of disciplines:
                                     engineering, psychology, cognitive science, education, philosophy 
                                     (particularly philosophy of science), technology, theology, sociology.</p>
